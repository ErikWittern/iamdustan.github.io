title: Some Basics. ClojureScript for JavaScript Developers.

This is likely a topic written much better by others, but for the sake of
completeness Iâ€™m going to write anyway.

This is intended to be an incomplete introduction to clojurescript semantics as
it relates to the JS-as-a-first-language brain.

We are only going to talk about two things.

1. Defining variables.
2. Calling functions.
