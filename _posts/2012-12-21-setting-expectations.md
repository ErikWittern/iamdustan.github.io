Expectations are everywhere. They permeate through every aspect of daily life. How I survived to the age of 27 without realizing this is beyond me, but perhaps it is beyond you, too.

I&rsquo;ve had the great pleasure of working with some really smart
people at [Skookum](http://skookum.com) over the past year. As
I&rsquo;ve been adjusting to working with others; both writing code that
others must follow, and following others, I have learned the importance
of making sure the code you write, the patterns you follow, and the
style you use appropriately set expectation to a future reader of it.
